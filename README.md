# FakeVideoDetection
Deep Fake video detection using Neural Networks


## Comments on presentation:
Motivation
State of the art/Related work
Milestones
Progress till date
Datasets : train test val split, data augmentation -> Talk about compression issues
Approach
Show results(atleast some) : working pipeline : some train val curves

3D conv
2d encoder decoder

why for both models? How feasible?
Size of the network

loss function
is the network using information from previous frame or next frame?
visualization of dataset

Lucid data dreaming (check for video processing)



* people who are trying to refine fake videos, we can check our final model with their outputs (Colleli)
